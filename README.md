# CODSOFT_TASK-01_ToDo
During my internship at CODSOFT, I had the privilege to work on a dynamic Android To-Do App project. This app is designed to help users manage their tasks, increase productivity, and stay organized seamlessly. It was an incredible learning experience, and I am thrilled to share the codebase and project documentation here.
